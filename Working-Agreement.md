# We make commitments as a team

* We will be held accountable to our commitments

# Incomplete stories are not good 

* It is better to help get an existing story to "Done" than to start another story that cannot be finished in the current sprint

# Stories should not span across Sprints

* Stories that are incomplete at the end of Sprints should be reduced to what has been completed, and a new story is created for the remaining outcomes

# Stories should have a Parent Feature

* When new stories are added to the Backlog they must have an appropriate Parent Feature

# Daily Standups

* Discuss potential solutions outside of standup
* Plan new or existing work outside of standup; Attend planning sessions or schedule sessions with necessary stakeholders
* Keep it short and to the three items:
  * What you did yesterday?
  * What are going to do today?
  * Any blockers/issues?
