# Show respect

* Do not interrupt; Let people finish what theyâ€™re saying
* It is okay to disagree with each other
* No personal attacks, attack issues, we debate the merit of ideas, not people

# Contribution

* Everyone has equal voice and valuable contribution

# Meetings

* Be on time
* End on time
* Have an agenda
* Schedule meetings with at least 24 hours notice

# Be transparent

* No hidden agendas
* We will give feedback
* We will receive feedback
* We will act on feedback

# Impediments

* Solve roadblocks within the team
* If the impediment cannot be solved within the team, give it to the Scrum master

# We make commitments as a team

* We will be held accountable to our commitments.
* We work as a team to make a commitment and deliver on it

# Incomplete stories are not good 

* It is better to help get an existing story to "Done" than to start another story that cannot be finished in the current sprint

# Stories should not span across Sprints

* Stories that are incomplete at the end of Sprints should be reduced to what has been completed, and a new story is created for the remaining outcomes

# Stories should have a Parent Feature

* When new stories are added to the Backlog they must have an appropriate Parent Feature

# Daily Standups

* Don't solution during standup
* Keep it short and to the three items:
  * What you did yesterday?
  * What are going to do today?
  * Any blockers/issues?
